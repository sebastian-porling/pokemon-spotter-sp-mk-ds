## Project, install, run, compile and deploy

This project utilizes Angular for frontend, express for backend and firebase for authentication and database.
You have to run `npm i` in the frontend and backend directories. To run in developer mode: open two terminals and run `npm run serve` in frontend and `npm run dev` on backend.

To compile and deploy run `ng build --prod` in frontend and `npm run build` in the backend folder. You can use the dockerfile to deploy the container.
